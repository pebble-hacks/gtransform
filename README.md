Transformation Matrix Implementation

![test_gtransform](test_gtransform.gif)

With affine transformations (i.e. transformation matrices), you can create
complex animation sequences with just a few lines of code. They greatly simplify
the logic you need and also support cascading of sequences. You can perform
operations such as scaling, rotating, translating, and sheering all with just a
single matrix.

The implementation can easily be compiled into your existing app. We've also
introduce a few new types to support this implementation including a fixed point
math library and vectors. Included is also a sample app that implements the
animation sequence you see above. Take look at our implementation and feel free
to provide us with any feedback you have. We look forward to seeing what amazing
things you can do with it!
